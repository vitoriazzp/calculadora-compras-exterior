# Redesign of the fee calculator in international purchases of gov.br

## Problem 
The user interested in using it needs to do the calculation and check if the store they will buy from is on the list of "partner stores" manually. Outside this list, import taxes are higher, as they do not have a discount. 

Another point is that despite displaying the dollar rate, the person needs to manually convert the value into real to put it in the calculator, which can make it difficult since the person may be dealing with dollar values instead of reais. 

## Solution 
Automation of the calculation of fees and also conversion of the value to be in real or dollar. Check whether or not the store entered by the person is on the list of partner stores. 

Leaving the person only to understand the value for the purchase and the fees that the Federal Government of Brazil will apply.
